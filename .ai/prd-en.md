# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - AI Flashcards

## 1. Product Overview

AI Flashcards is a web application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards. It allows users to generate flashcards using artificial intelligence based on pasted text, as well as create them manually. The application includes basic flashcard management functions (viewing, editing, deleting), a user account system for storing data, and integration with a pre-built spaced repetition algorithm. The goal is to minimize the time required to create flashcards and encourage the use of effective learning methods.

## 2. User Problem

Manually creating high-quality educational flashcards is a time-consuming and tedious process. It requires the user not only to identify key information but also to synthesize and format it appropriately. This effort often discourages the regular creation and use of flashcards, even though they are a recognized and effective learning method, especially when combined with the spaced repetition technique. The lack of a quick and easy way to generate flashcards is a barrier for many potential users.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- RF-001: User Account System:
  - Registration via email address and password.
  - Email address format validation during registration.
  - Minimum password length requirement (4 characters) during registration.
  - User login.
  - Ability for the user to delete their account (with a confirmation step).
- RF-002: Manual Flashcard Creation:
  - Form with two text fields: "front" and "back".
  - Character limit for the "front" field: 200 characters.
  - Character limit for the "back" field: 500 characters.
  - Visible character counter for both form fields.
  - Validation of character limits performed when attempting to save/submit the form.
  - Display of predefined validation error messages separately for each field (e.g., "The 'front' field has exceeded the character limit.").
  - Saving the created flashcard in a database associated with the user's account.
- RF-003: AI-Powered Flashcard Generation:
  - Text field for the user to paste source material.
  - Button to initiate the AI-powered flashcard generation process based on the pasted text.
  - AI-generated flashcard suggestions (candidates) presented to the user for review.
- RF-004: Review of Flashcard Candidates (AI-Generated):
  - Display of a list of flashcard candidates.
  - Each candidate visually marked with an "@" icon (size 16x16px) to distinguish it from accepted flashcards.
  - Ability to edit the content of the "front" and "back" fields of each candidate.
  - Ability to accept a candidate – saves the flashcard to the database and removes the "@" marker.
  - Ability to reject a candidate – removes the suggestion without saving.
  - Validation of character limits (front: 200, back: 500) during editing and when attempting to accept a candidate.
- RF-005: Flashcard Management:
  - Display of a list of the user's saved flashcards.
  - Ability to edit existing flashcards (while maintaining character limit validation).
  - Ability to delete existing flashcards.
- RF-006: Integration with Spaced Repetition Algorithm:
  - Passing the user's saved flashcards to an external, pre-built spaced repetition algorithm (integration details TBD, but the system must be prepared for this).
  - Interface for conducting review sessions according to the logic of the provided algorithm.
- RF-007: Flashcard Generation Statistics:
  - The system collects information about the number of flashcards generated by AI.
  - The system collects information about the number of flashcards accepted by the user from those generated by AI.
  - Statistics are available to the user in the form of a summary on the main dashboard.

## 4. Product Boundaries

The following functionalities are intentionally NOT included in the scope of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

- Implementation of a custom, advanced spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., similar to the SM-2 algorithms used in SuperMemo or Anki). Instead, a pre-built, simpler mechanism will be integrated.
- Importing flashcards or source materials from files in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, CSV, Anki pkg). The only method of entering data into the AI is copy-paste.
- Social features, such as sharing flashcard sets between users, commenting, or rating.
- Integrations with external educational platforms, LMS systems, or other tools.
- Dedicated mobile applications (iOS, Android). The product will be available exclusively as a web application.
- Advanced text formatting options in flashcard fields (e.g., bold, italics, lists).
- Tagging or categorization mechanisms for flashcards.
- Advanced validation error logging on the server-side (beyond standard application logging).
- Configurable user interface settings.
