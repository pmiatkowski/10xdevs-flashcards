# Refactoring Summary: Form Validation and Error Handling (2025-04-23)

## Authentication Forms

### LoginForm Improvements

- Added proper Zod schema validation with error handling
- Implemented ARIA-compliant error messages with role="alert"
- Fixed form submission to properly handle validation errors before API calls
- Added type safety for form data and error states
- Improved loading state handling and UI feedback

### FormField Component Enhancements

- Added proper ARIA attributes for accessibility (aria-invalid, aria-describedby)
- Implemented error message display with role="alert"
- Improved type safety with ComponentPropsWithoutRef
- Added support for form validation feedback
- Enhanced input field styling based on validation state

## Testing Improvements

### LoginForm Tests

- Added comprehensive validation testing
- Improved test readability and maintainability
- Added coverage for loading states and error scenarios
- Fixed form submission test cases

### General Testing Updates

- Improved mocking patterns for Zod validation
- Enhanced error handling test coverage
- Added accessibility testing for form components
- Fixed async test issues with proper waitFor usage

## Test Suite Improvements

### useFlashcards Hook Tests

- Enhanced validation testing for character limits
- Added proper cleanup in test teardown
- Improved loading state test coverage
- Added test cases for edge cases in validation
- Fixed async test timing issues

### RegisterForm Tests

- Updated Zod schema mock to properly handle all validation cases
- Added proper type definitions for validation errors
- Enhanced error message assertions
- Improved test coverage for form submission states

### useReviewKeyboard Tests

- Added proper cleanup after keyboard event tests
- Fixed event listener memory leaks
- Improved test coverage for keyboard interactions
- Enhanced testing of input element focus handling

### Response Handling Tests

- Added comprehensive error handling test coverage

- Enhanced network error handling test cases
- Added tests for malformed API responses

## Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling

- Improved Zod schema type inference
- Enhanced component prop types
- Fixed type issues in test mocks

### Accessibility

- Added proper ARIA attributes
- Implemented semantic HTML structure
- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Improved screen reader compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar improvements to remaining auth forms:
   - RegisterForm
   - ForgotPasswordForm
   - ResetPasswordForm

2. Update AIGenerationForm:
   - Add Zod validation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Enhance accessibility

3. Update FlashcardListItem:
   - Implement inline editing with proper validation
   - Add ARIA attributes for edit mode
   - Enhance error handling

4. General improvements:
   - Create shared Zod schemas for common validations
   - Extract common form patterns into hooks
   - Standardize loading state patterns
